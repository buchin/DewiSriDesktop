<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/nddrylliog/ooc">ooc</A> is a statically typed, object oriented language with some functional programming hints that’s growing up right here on GitHub. The compiler is currently written in Java, and it boils down to C99 so it can run anywhere. Grab the zip from the Downloads section or clone away and <A href="http://ooc-lang.org/setup">set it up</A>. The language has some <A href="http://ooc-lang.org/">neat features</A>: everyone’s favorite generic types, a clean <CODE>import</CODE>/<CODE>use</CODE> system that makes Ruby’s <CODE>require</CODE> look like yesterday’s news, and the <CODE>cover</CODE> keyword that allows for some really neat abstractions over types and clean interfacing with other C code.

<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/jeresig/testswarm">testswarm</A></STRONG> is John Resig of <A href="http://github.com/jquery">jQuery</A> fame’s latest adventure in advancing the web. I first saw this demoed at <A href="http://developer-day.com/">Developer Day Boston</A> and was completely blown away. It’s distributed testing for JavaScript, brought to the max. The server basically gives each client a test suite, and they report the status of the tests back for the given browser. You can then watch results flying back to the server <A href="http://wiki.github.com/jeresig/testswarm">in real time</A>. This is a new kind of approach for dealing with browser testing on a grand scale, and it’s definitely worth <A href="http://testswarm.com/">a watch</A> to see where it goes.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/bloopletech/webstats">webstats</A></STRONG> is a Ruby-based web interface to monitoring your Linux web server’s health.

This is a cheap way to implement monitoring if you’re concerned about it, and it even comes baked in with an email and Growl notifier if something goes haywire.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/auxesis/visage">Visage</A></STRONG> is another great option in the Ruby world of server stats apps.

<H3 xmlns="">Featured Project</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/280north/cappuccino">cappuccino</A></STRONG> takes web application development to a new level. Using a superset of JavaScript called <A href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/tutorials/objective-j-tutorial.php">Objective-J</A>, <A href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</A> makes it really easy to create sites that look and feel like a desktop application. The <SPAN class="caps">API</SPAN> abstracts away the low level details of building a site (<SPAN class="caps">HTML</SPAN>, <SPAN class="caps">CSS</SPAN>, JS, the <SPAN class="caps">DOM</SPAN>, etc) and lets you focus on building your application. Check out <A href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides</A> to see just how fully featured and integrated the framework is. It also can make some really <A href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/demos/">nice</A> (and <A href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/demos/LightsOff/">addictive</A>) iPhone apps.</P>
<H3 xmlns="">Notably New Projects</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/centro/shudder">shudder</A></STRONG> is a testing framework for JavaScript that’s based on <A href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey</A>. The project is just getting started, but I’m really liking the <A href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</A> inspired <A href="http://github.com/centro/shudder/tree/master/test/example/example_test.js">syntax of the test cases</A>. This could really pick up some steam if it was proven on some of the bigger JS frameworks or someone ported tests to it.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/royw/railroad_xing">railroad</A></STRONG> isn’t exactly new, but it was just imported onto GitHub this last week. If you ever need to visualize the relationships of classes in your Rails or Merb app, Railroad is your answer. It creates files that <A href="http://www.graphviz.org/">dot and neato</A> can read and produce some <A href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/diagrams/depot_models_full.png">really</A> <A href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/diagrams/depot_controllers_full.png">nice</A> diagrams of how your application is laid out. Check out plenty of more examples on their <A href="http://railroad.rubyforge.org/">homepage</A>.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/temiy/luv">luv</A></STRONG>: Who needs another <SPAN class="caps">MVC</SPAN> web framework? Who needs to test it? And seriously, who needs to write it in Lua? If you answered “I do!” to any or all of the following questions, Luv is your new favorite project. Luv claims to be faster than many of the modern Ruby, Python, and <SPAN class="caps">PHP</SPAN> frameworks, so perhaps we’ll see some benchmarks (or demo sites?) soon. Until then, I’m going to be watching and hoping to see something exciting being done with Lua outside of World of Warcraft add-ons.</P>
<H3 xmlns="">Hardcore Forker of the Week</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG>John Nunemaker (<A href="http://github.com/jnunemaker">jnunemaker</A>)</STRONG> is one of the most prolific Rails and Ruby <A href="http://railstips.org/">hackers</A> and <A href="http://addictedtonew.com/">bloggers</A> and out there. His goal seems to be making coding fun (and slightly wacky too). He started the <A href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree">HTTParty</A>, an easy way to interact with <SPAN class="caps">REST</SPAN> and <SPAN class="caps">HTTP</SPAN> than mucking around with the other Ruby alternatives. He’s also got plenty of other helpful projects: <A href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/happymapper">HappyMapper</A>, an object to xml mapping library, a <A href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter">command line interface</A> to Twitter, and even a way to generate dummy Lorem Ipsum text <A href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/lorem/tree/master">in your terminal</A> as well. John is always up to something neat and extremely useful here on GitHub, and definitely is worth following just to see what he’s been up to.</P></div></div><div style="clear: both;"/><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://rebase.github.com/7.html">GitHub Rebase 7</a><div class="lastUpdated">December 7, 2008 3:00 PM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://rebase.github.com/atom.xml" class="feedEntryContent"><P xmlns="">Welcome to the seventh edition of Rebase! Starting this week I’ll be nominating a new repo to the “Featured Project” section on the front page, and explaining why I think it deserves the honor here.</P>
<H3 xmlns="">Featured Project</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master">cucumber</A></STRONG>: Cucumber is fast becoming the standard for acceptance testing in Rails. It’s the replacement for the RSpec story runner, but it doesn’t stop there: it’s now totally free of any RSpec dependencies. The <A href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/home">project’s wiki</A> is chock full of helpful examples, ways to use it with other testing frameworks/application platforms, and more. What’s best about it is that it’s mostly written in plain text, something your managers/clients can definitely understand. Take a dive into the <SPAN class="caps">BDD</SPAN> mindset if you haven’t already and see how it can help your project out.</P>

<H3 xmlns="">Notably New Projects</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/mattetti/merb-book/tree/master">merb-book</A></STRONG>: This just got started earlier this week following an announcement on <A href="http://merbist.com/2008/12/04/annoucing-the-merb-open-source-book/">The Merbist</A> and it’s seen a <A href="http://github.com/mattetti/merb-book/network">flurry of activity</A> within its first week. The point of the project is to offer superb documentation to those who are willing to try out Merb but don’t necessarily want to pay for one of the other books that will soon be available, and also to provide translations. If you want to see the work in progress, check it out here too: <A href="http://book.merbist.com/">http://book.merbist.com/</A></P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/amoore/perlchallenge/tree/master">perlchallenge</A></STRONG>: This repo hosts a site that leads you through programming exercises in Perl to hone your craft with the language. (This is a refreshing change from the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Golf_Apocalypse"><SPAN class="caps">PGA</SPAN></A>) If you’re looking to get into Perl, this is a simple and interactive way to get acquainted with it. <A href="http://www.perlchallenge.com/">Are you up for the challenge?</A></P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/spdr870/gitextensions">gitextensions</A></STRONG>: Earlier this week there was a call to action to create a <A href="http://github.com/blog/256-tortoisegit-challenge">TortoiseGit for Windows</A>, along with an associated <A href="http://github.com/schacon/git-cheetah/tree/master">git-cheetah</A> project that already has a head start on Explorer integration in Windows. If you’re looking for a way to use Git with Visual Studio 2008 though, look no further than the gitextensions project. <A href="http://sourceforge.net/dbimage.php?id=195717">They already have a good head start too.</A> If you’re a Windows developer, contributing to either of these projects would mean a lot to the future of Git.</P>
<H3 xmlns="">Hardcore Forker</H3>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG>Evan Phoenix (<A href="https://github.com/evanphx">evanphx</A>)</STRONG> is the leader of the <A href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</A> project, which is a Ruby VM built in mostly Ruby and C++ that <A href="http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/tree/master">lives right here on GitHub</A>. This project is a goldmine for those who want to learn more about VMs or just to see how they’ve implemented some of the features in the Ruby language. He’s turned the project into a truly community focused one: submit a patch and you automatically get commit rights. Contributing is also quite simple: run your favorite Ruby apps on Rubinius, and see if anything is broken or not supported.  Evan’s work with Rubinius is a great example of a radical yet successful way to run an open source project that allows contributors to easily jump in, have fun, and make a difference.</P>
<P xmlns="">I was planning on creating some new monthly graphs for November this week, but it just didn’t work out. There were some holes in my data collection for November and I want to ensure as much accuracy as possible with the graphs. (Also, downloading and parsing ~6200 <SPAN class="caps">RSS</SPAN> pages with 30 events each takes a chunk of time too). Consider this a raincheck for some cooler ones at the end of this month.</P></div></div><div style="clear: both;"/><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://rebase.github.com/6.html">GitHub Rebase 6</a><div class="lastUpdated">November 30, 2008 3:00 PM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://rebase.github.com/atom.xml" class="feedEntryContent"><P xmlns="">Welcome to the sixth edition of Rebase!

<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/paulwilliam/webarchiver/tree">webarchiver</A></STRONG> is a tiny Objective-C project that allows the creation of Safari <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webarchive">.webarchive</A> files, which is a convenient way of storing all of a website’s files: css, js, images along with <SPAN class="caps">HTML</SPAN>. This is way easier than looking up all of the files for a site manually, and it’s a command line tool so you won’t need to open your browser to do it. Not really portable though, but it’s fast and easy on <SPAN class="caps">OSX</SPAN>. More information <A href="http://www.entropytheblog.com/blog/2008/11/webarchiver-create-safari-webarchives-from-the-command-line/">here.</A></P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/andykent/jss/tree">jss</A></STRONG> is simple: CSS3 support in any browser that already supports jQuery. Sounds awesome to me! Comes with plenty of tests, a ridiculously simple <SPAN class="caps">API</SPAN>, and even caching. Check this out if you want to live on the edge of <SPAN class="caps">CSS</SPAN> design.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG><A href="http://github.com/olliesaunders/suprdate/tree/master">suprdate</A></STRONG> is a kickass <SPAN class="caps">DSL</SPAN> for working with dates in Ruby. Makes traversal and iteration of dates really easy, and suprisingly has an infinite loop built into it. Who says you can’t model the end of time in code? Can also filter dates, make ranges, and much more. If you need to do anything complicated with long spans dates in Ruby, I’d check suprdate first.</P>

<P xmlns=""><STRONG>Pieter de Bie (<A href="http://github.com/pieter">pieter</A>)</STRONG> is the brains behind <A href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</A>, a gui app for browsing your git repositories on <SPAN class="caps">OSX</SPAN>. GitX is <A href="http://gitx.frim.nl/seeit.html">definitely way easier on the eyes and mind</A> if you need a break from the command line. This alone qualifies him as a hardcore forker in my book. Lately he’s also been <A href="http://github.com/pieter/draggabledownloadplugin/tree">hacking on Safari plugins</A>. This is definitely one to watch if you’re into <SPAN class="caps">OSX</SPAN>/Cocoa/Objective-C development.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG>Antonin Hildebrand (<A href="http://github.com/woid">woid</A>)</STRONG> is up to some really neat things here on GitHub that deserved to be checked out even if you’re not a Pythonista. Probably the most useful is <A href="http://github.com/woid/firepython/tree/master">firepython</A>, which allows for console logging of your Python app, be it Django or what have you, through Firebug. <A href="http://github.com/woid/firepython-addon/tree/master/support/screenshot.png?raw=true">And it looks pretty slick too.</A> Another upcoming creation of his is <A href="http://github.com/woid/drydrop/tree/master">drydrop</A>, which uses git and Google App Engine to deploy static <SPAN class="caps">HTML</SPAN> sites without needing to know Python.</P>
<P xmlns=""><STRONG>Neuros Technology (<A href="http://github.com/neuros">neuros</A>)</STRONG> is a shining example of a company that has really embraced the open source community and transparency in the development process. They offer a <A href="http://www.neurostechnology.com/">set-top box</A>  that can organize, archive, and play nearly any video content online, and the code that runs it is completely open (and here on GitHub!). Oh yeah, they also have <A href="http://open.neurostechnology.com/category/projects/bounties">occasional bounties</A> for features if you’re looking to earn some money on open-source hacking.</P>

<P xmlns="">As always, suggestions for improvements (and projects to cover!) are welcome. I’d love to break down the huge spikes in the activity or perhaps add an entirely new graph. I would also like to see some projects using <A href="http://github.com/languages">other languages than Ruby</A> next week.</P></div></div><div style="clear: both;"/><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://rebase.github.com/2.html">GitHub Rebase 2</a><div class="lastUpdated">November 2, 2008 2:00 PM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://rebase.github.com/atom.xml" class="feedEntryContent"><P xmlns="">It looks like I’ve been enlisted as an official blogger to bring you the latest and greatest work that’s coming out of GitHub!

<H3 xmlns="">Notably New Projects</H3>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master">Authlogic</A>: The self proclaimed “Chuck Norris of authentication solutions.” It’s a new, refreshing look at doing authentication in Rails (and any framework, really) that doesn’t rely on generators to inject code into your app. Still needs a lot of documentation and tutorials, but it’s definitely looking promising. (Note: the project’s first commit was on 10/24, but it started really gaining watchers and attention this week.)</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin/tree/master">Ronin</A>: Simply put, Ronin is a hacker’s swiss army knife. You can test your apps for security vulnerabilities with it or even punch holes through your servers via a multitude of different protocols. This project lived on RubyForge for a while, but it’s just nestled into a new home here on GitHub. Clone away!</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/nakajima/roleful/tree/master">roleful</A>: A <SPAN class="caps">DSL</SPAN>-ified way to describe permissions for objects, such as when you need to define what different classes/levels of users can do inside of your application. Keeps your models clean and is quite elegant in its execution.</P>
<H3 xmlns="">Most Watched</H3>

<P xmlns="">Next week I’d love to get a new graph up, perhaps hourly events so we can really see what times of day the hackers come out.

Using the magic of feed-normalizer, hpricot, and gchartrb, I’ve created a little Rails app (dubbed <A href="http://github.com/qrush/rebase/tree/master">Rebase</A>, of course) that I can use to rip all of the events that are going on at GitHub. I’m going to try to keep the format of the column consistent, but I definitely need your feedback to make it better.</LI>

<H2 xmlns="">Notably New Projects</H2>
<P xmlns="">Each week I’m going to look over some interesting new projects that have just showed up on GitHub and explain what they’re about. If you have a project you think I should showcase, let me know and I’ll see about featuring it!</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="https://github.com/josh/wysihat/tree">Wysihat</A>: A minimalist’s approach to <SPAN class="caps">WYSIWYG</SPAN>/Rich Text Editor. Right now it’s very, very beta, but it has the support of 37Signals so I definitely hope it’s destined for greatness. Once some decent themes are created for it, I’d definitely consider integrating it in some of my sites. This project definitely is growing and needs help, so fork away.</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/android">Android</A>: Google announced that their Android framework was going open source and was hosted on Git, so it was clearly only a matter of time before their code landed on GitHub too. They have a ton of projects in their codebase, but it doesn’t seem like all of them have pushed yet. Definitely looks promising though, and I really would like to see how their system works.</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/webco/acts_as_passive_aggressive/tree/master">acts_as_passive_aggressive</A>: Just in case you ever needed a way to vent on your users, this plugin provides the perfect opportunity. I love the project’s readme.</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/davetroy/votereport/tree/master">VoteReport</A>: This is a new Rails site to track the election next week through Twitter. They’ve got quite a lot of documentation on their <A href="http://votereport.pbwiki.com/FrontPage">PBWiki</A>, and I really hope that this site turns out to be a little more useful and fun than watching tweets fly by on Twitter’s election page. If you want to help them get the project up and running before the 4th, go for it!</P>
<P xmlns=""><A href="http://github.com/biilmann/javascript-xhtml-purifier/tree">javascript-xhtml-purifier</A>: A new, robust JS script to sanitize <SPAN class="caps">HTML</SPAN>. I can guarantee that at some point most web developers will need to do this, so bookmark or clone away. <BR/>
Next week I’d love to break down the stats a little more and figure out what commits were the most commented on, and maybe which projects had the most activity. Let me know what you’d like to see in the future!</P></div></div><div style="clear: both;"/></div>
